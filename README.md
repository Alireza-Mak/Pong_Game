# About the Project: Pong Game
In this Python script, I implemented a Pong game using the Turtle graphics library. The game involves controlling paddles with keyboard inputs to prevent a bouncing ball from passing them. The Scoreboard class keeps track of scores, declaring a winner when a player reaches a score of 10. This code provides a concise and enjoyable Pong gaming experience, capturing the essence of the classic arcade game.
